If you want to RUN the information collection for ONE ACCOUNT onto a SINGLE REGION:
  1)  Execute the command "my_run_scripts.sh <region-anme>".
      This will gather the account, you must have your bash configured, and aws-cli installed.
      Be sure jq and tee are in your PATH.
  2)  You will get the files with the format <account-id>_<region>_<topic>_info.txt
  
  Execute the script as follows, for example:
    ```./run_single_region.sh eu-west-1```

If you want to RUN the information collection for ONE ACCOUNT onto MULTIPLE REGIONS:
  1) Edit the file regions.txt and define the regions where you want to collect the information.
  2) Ensure the regions names are valid, and como separated witout any spaces.
     Ex:   us-west-1,eu-west-1,eu-west-2
  3) Execute the command ./multi_region_run.sh
  4) You will get the files with the format <account-id>_<region>_<topic>_info.txt for EACH of the Regions.

    Execute the script as follows, for example:
    ./run_multi_region.sh

  To zip output data, cd into the Discovery_Reports folder in root directory and run ``` zip -r discovery_reports.zip . ```
